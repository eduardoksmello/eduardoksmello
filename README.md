## Hi there 👋
### My names is Eduardo.
I'm a data analyst with skills relevant to collection, cleaning, statistical treatment, and data visualization. I'm fascinated by the entire data pipeline, from integration to visualization. Therefore, I am studying the processes pertinent to engineering, machine learning, and data analysis. 
Currently, I work as a business intelligence analyst and am taking a bootcamp in data engineering (How Bootcamps).

Background: Doctorate in Music Cognition. 

🌱 I’m currently learning continuous integration with Jenkins.

:computer: Most familiar tools, languages and frameworks:
- Python (VSCode, Pycharm, Jupyter, Google Colab, Terminal)
- SQL (PosgreSQL, BigQuery, DBeaver)
- Pandas, Numpy, Scipy
- Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels
- BeautifulSoup
- NLTK
- Matplotlib, Ploty, Seaborn
- Power BI, Data Studio, Metabase
- SPSS, Excel, Google Sheets, PowerPoint, Word
- Windows, Linux, Mac OS
